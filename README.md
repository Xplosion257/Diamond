# This is a repo where I make my own language.
I plan to make it large enough that it can become a recongized language and a popular one too.
Right now, I'm trying to __make custom libraries__.
If you want to contribute, add more to the rng module and make a time module. The date module should have date.Date() which returns the date and time. Other features should be date.seconds() which is the same as time.Time(). Add more features like FPS and delta time.
